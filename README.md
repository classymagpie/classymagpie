## About me

Hi, I'm Porfirio, and this is my GitHub page. I recently defended my dissertation and am currently on the Job Hunt. I'm new to GitHub and figuring out how things work. I've uploaded some scripts concerning bioinformatics (see DMD-3CHIPSEQ repo), but I'm interested in learning more about coding languages, so I am creating an "About me" _readme.md_ page to get in some practice. I hope you like it and perhaps get to know me a little along the way. I'm open to collaborative projects and learning more, please feel free to contact me! 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning these languages along with their applications ...

|     3| Java      |
