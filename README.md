## About me

Hi, I'm Porfirio, and this is my GitHub page. I recently defended my dissertation and am transitioning to the Job Hunt as I finish my first-author manuscript ðŸª±. I have experience using shell scripts to process genomic data through a high-performance cluster (HPC) at my home institution. However, I am still new to GitHub, so I'm here to figure out how things work. I've uploaded some scripts concerning bioinformatics for my thesis work (see DMD-3CHIPSEQ repo). I'm interested in learning more about coding languages and hope to practice novice web-based development eventually. So, I am creating an "About me" _readme.md_ page to get in some practice. I hope you like it and get to know me a little along the way. I'm open to collaborative projects and learning more, and please feel free to contact me (pf887@nyu.edu)! 


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning these languages along with their applications ...
