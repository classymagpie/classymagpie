## About me in the context of coding

Hi, I'm Porfirio, and this is my GitHub page. I recently defended my Ph.D. dissertation and am transitioning to the job hunt as I concurrently finish my first-author manuscript 🪱. I have experience using shell/bash scripts to process genomic data through a high-performance cluster (HPC) at my home institution. However, I am still new to GitHub, so I'm here to figure out how things work (getting out of my comfort zone by trying different things). I've uploaded some scripts concerning bioinformatics I used for my thesis work (see DMD-3CHIPSEQ repo). I'm interested in learning more about coding in a general sense and hope to eventually practice novice web-based development. I am creating an "About me" _readme.md_ page to get in some practice and get my feet wet. I hope you like this funky Frankenstein-esk page and get to know me a little along the way. I'm open to collaborative projects and learning more. Please feel free to contact me. 


🔭 In the table below are the languages im dibbling and dabbling with, little by little. As a bonus, you can find a photograph of my sidekick on the right side 🐈, she's so motivational!
